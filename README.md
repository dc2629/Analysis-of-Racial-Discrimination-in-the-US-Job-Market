# Analysis-of-Racial-Discrimination-in-the-US-Job-Market

### Racial discrimination continues to be pervasive in cultures throughout the world. Researchers examined the level of racial discrimination in the United States labor market by randomly assigning identical résumés to black-sounding or white-sounding names and observing the impact on requests for interviews from employers.

## Conclusion
This examination of the data does show strong statistical correlation that race/name has an effect on your success in job searches but it does not prove that this is the only or most important factor for getting a callback. After doing some basic graphical analysis of some of the other factors (including years of experience, education, gender, and working at school), other interesting factors arises. Having more experience will correlate with having a better chance at getting called back. Females have a higher chance than males of getting a callback and this pattern exists in both white and black applicants. There were no white applicants in this dataset that had no education (0 years) and black applicants had a greater chance of being callback at 1 year of experience but far less after that. 

## Further discussion
There can be further analysis that could be done to determine if the type of job (sales, administrative, and clerical) will effect the callback percentages for white/black applicants.
